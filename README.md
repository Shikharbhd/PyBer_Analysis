# PYBER_CHALLENGE

## Overview of the Analysis:

The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an overview comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surb-urban, and urban cities. The analysis studies the data between January 2019 and May 2019 particularly focuses on the following parameters.

a.	Total rides by city types 

b.	Total drivers by city types 

c.	Total fares by city types 

d.	Average fares by city types

e.	Average fares per driver

## Results: 

The summary demonstrates that there is a larger demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities consequently resulting in larger number of drivers operating and greater transaction. The figure (Fig1) below highlights how rides in Urban cities contributed the most to PyBer's overall rides during this five-month period. 
![Fig1.Pyber_Summary.png](https://github.com/Shikharbhd/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge_Analysis/Fig1.Pyber_Summary.png).

There were 1,625 rides in urban cities, accounting for 68.4% of the total rides, 625 rides (26.3%) in suburban cities, and 125 rides (5.3%) in rural cities.

Likewise, larger volume of drivers operated in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities (86.7%) compared to 490 drivers(12.5%) in suburban cities, and 78 drivers (0.8%) in rural cities. Again, the chart below depicts the significance of drivers in urban cities during this time period.

However, In terms of costs, it appears that riders in rural cities pay on average almost $10 more for PyBer than riders in urban cities. The average fare per ride is about $35 in rural cities whereas the average fare per ride is about $25 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per ride falls just in between - at about $31.

Likewise, average fare per driver is about $55 in rural cities, whereas the average fare per driver is about $17 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per driver is about $40.

Given that there is a greater usage of PyBer in urban cities, the total fares are consequently also higher than suburban and rural cities. PyBer transactions in urban cities totaled nearly $40,000 (62.7%) whereas transactions in suburban cities and rural cities totaled at least $19,000(30.5%) and $4,000(6.8%) respectively.

The multiple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type" further supports the PyBer Summary DataFrame by providing trends of total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities between January 2019 and April 2019. All three types of cities have a rather slow start in the begining of the year with one noteworthy peak in the end of February. The yellow trend shows how fares in urban cities totaled from around $1,600 to $2,300 from beginning to end during this five-month period. In contrast, the blue trend shows how fares in rural cities totaled around $300 from beginning to end during the same time period. The orange trend shows how the total fares in suruban cities fall in between urban and rural cities around $700 to $1,300 from beginning to end during this time.

## Summary:

a.	There is a larger use of PyBer ridesharing in urban cities.

b.	There are more drivers in urban cities than rural cities.

c.â€¢	As a result, the majority of PyBer's revenue occurs in urban cities.

d.	Average cost per ride and average driver fare per ride is higher in rural areas.

## Recommendations:

a. Greater costs for using PyBer in rural cities could discourage potential riders from using PyBer.

b.	Higher fare prices in rural areas could be a potential factor for urban city drivers to potentially move into rural cities resulting in shortage of ride amongst urban riders. Perhaps, incentives (bonus) to city drivers could prevent this from happening.

## Additional Analysis Requirement:

a.	Factors that are contributing to the high ride costs in rural cities such as travel distance can also be analyzed, however it is missing in the dataset.
